// A variable is a named reference to a value.That way we can access unpredicatble value using predictable name.

// ways to declare variable:
// we can declare variable using var, let and const
// for example 
// const name = "Hellow";
// let age = 10;
// var gender = "female";
// we can even declare variable without using var const and let but it is not recmmended to do so.
// rollNo = 234567;
//if we declare variable but do not initialse value to it.if we try to print value of the variable it will give out as undefined .for ex:
// let permission ;
// console.log(permission);//undefined

//  difference between var and let: both are used to declare variables
// var : it is functional scope , can declare variable again even if it has been defined previously in the same scope  
// let : it has blocked scope, cannot declare variable more than once if we defined that previously in the same scope
// js strict mode 
// js strict mode is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of jS
